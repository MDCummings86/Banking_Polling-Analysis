Python Exercise

Had some troube with this exercise, so I sought out help from Ask BCS and through tutoring. I did get help understanding how to write the for loops, so the reader could iterate over the rows in each list I designated. I wasn't able to figure out the formatting for the output to the txt file as it didn't work the same way for the terminal print. I see something is off with my delimeter as I write the file output, but I don't see how to remove the delimeter so I left it as a space to look less crazy. I found a site explaining how to format the output for percentages with decimals, which I cited in the comments. 

In tutoring I discovered I could use 'if-then' statements to determine the greatest increase and decrease and that I could reopen the file in a DictReader with the append function to calculate the revenue. I also used append to iterate through the rows in PyPoll so each candidate could have their counted votes.

I mainly referred to House of Pies, Comic Book, writecsv, kid in a candy store and functions for the len, loops, append, sum, max, min, etc.
